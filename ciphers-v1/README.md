## 🧲️**Ciphers-1** 🧰️

## 💡**Main idea**💡
Write a program that encrypts and decrypts a text file of any size containing text in a given language using the following encryption algorithms:
- two permutation ciphers (the “**railway fence**” method (text in Russian) and the **rotating lattice** method (text in English), use a 4x4 lattice size and encryption scheme as in the example in Figure 1.3 p.6);
- substitution cipher - **Vigenère algorithm**, progressive key, text in Russian.
For all algorithms, the key is set from the keyboard by the user.
The program must ignore all characters that are not letters of the specified alphabet, and encrypt only text in the specified language. All algorithms must be implemented in one program.

The result of the program's operation is an encrypted/decrypted file/s.
