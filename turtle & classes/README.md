## **Turtle & classes** 🐢

## 💡**Main idea**💡
Build a hierarchy of classes for displaying graphic shapes: line segment, checkerboard, ellipse, etc. - at least 6 shapes.
Distribute classes into modules. Create a list of shapes as a separate class.
In the main module of the program, various shapes are added to the list (static initialization),
after which drawing a list of shapes is used.
Everything must comply with the **SOLID** principles.

## 🔐**Tests**🔐
**Carry out different tests according to OOP principles:**
* The Single-Responsibility Principle (SRP)
* The Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
* The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
* The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
* The Dependency inversion Principle (DIP)<br>

**All tests were completed!**
