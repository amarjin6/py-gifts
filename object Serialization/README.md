## ðŸ”‹**Object Serialization**ðŸ”‹

## ðŸ’¡**Main idea**ðŸ’¡

```
Select a subject area and build a class hierarchy. The hierarchy must include at least 6 classes.
Implement serialization/deserialization of objects from the resulting class hierarchy to/from a file, the
serialization format is Text. The user interface must implement the following functions:
1) the ability to change the properties of objects (editing);
2) add/remove objects from the list;
3) serialization/deserialization of the list of objects.
Adding new classes to the hierarchy should not lead to the need to rewrite existing code, and not to use
if-else/switch-case, reflection.
