## ♟️**Graphics editor**♟️

## 💡**Main idea**💡
Extend the shape example so that you can create configuration at the user interface level.
There are several options: input of coordinates with the mouse, dialog input of values, input in a scripting language.
The student can choose any input method. The object is created in such a way that a new class is added to the system
optional changes to existing code (type selection using a case/switch statement and plural if not allowed).
The resulting program became the source of the original graphics editor.
